# 🚀 PhishGuard - Team Setup Guide

## 🎯 ONE SCRIPT TO RULE THEM ALL!

Your teammate has created a **single PowerShell script** that does everything automatically!

## 📋 What You Need (Just 2 things):

1. **Python 3.8+** - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Node.js** - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

## 🚀 How to Start (3 simple steps):

1. **Right-click** on `start_phishguard.ps1`
2. **Select** "Run with PowerShell"
3. **Wait** for the magic to happen! ✨

## 🔧 What the Script Does Automatically:

- ✅ Checks if Python and Node.js are installed
- ✅ Installs all backend dependencies (Python packages)
- ✅ Installs all frontend dependencies (Node.js packages)
- ✅ Starts the backend service (FastAPI + ML models)
- ✅ Starts the frontend service (Next.js + React)
- ✅ Opens the application in your browser
- ✅ Shows you exactly what's running and where

## 🌐 What You Get:

- **Main App**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Backend**: http://localhost:8000
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000

## 🛑 How to Stop:

Just **close the command windows** that opened when you ran the script.

## 🔄 How to Restart:

Just **run the script again**! It's that simple.

## 💡 Pro Tips:

- The script will tell you exactly what's happening at each step
- If something fails, it gives you helpful error messages
- All services run in separate windows so you can see what's happening
- The script is designed to be run multiple times safely

## 🎉 That's It!

No manual setup, no complex commands, no configuration files to edit. Just run the script and PhishGuard works!
